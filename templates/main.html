   <h1>WHY DO PUSH-PULL WORKOUTS?</h1>

   <p>There are several benefits to following this method of training. First off, push and pull exercises work different muscle groups throughout the days of the week. Splitting up the muscle groups in this way allows you to work them twice per week for maximum hypertrophy.</p>
   <p>Second, the push-and-pull method doesn't neglect leg day. Following the push-pull method, you can take one or even two days per week to work exclusively on the lower body, including the hamstrings, quads, and glutes. Incorporating leg exercises such as the leg curl, deadlift, and leg raise make the push-pull method a textbook full-body workout method.</p>
   <p>Third, the push-pull method allows your muscles to recover properly from exercise. For example, if you do push exercises the first day of the week, you won't work your push muscles again for another four days.</p>
   <p>For example, here is a typical weekly workout schedule for someone following the push-pull method:</p>
  </div>
    <p>Day 1: Push day</p>
    <p>Day 2: Pull day</p>
    <p>Day 3: Leg day</p>
    <p>Day 4: Rest day</p>
    <p>Day 5: Push day</p>
    <p>Day 6: Pull day</p>
    <p>Day 7: Cardio or rest</p>
