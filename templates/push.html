   <p>The flat dumbbell bench press is an excellent compound exercise to start your push day workout with. This exercise will mainly target your chest, but your shoulders and triceps will also come into play.</p>
   <p>Some prefer the dumbbell press over the bench press because, with dumbbells, you work unilaterally. That means that the stronger side of your body can't compensate for your weaker side.</p>
   <p>To perform this exercise properly:</p>
   <p>Lie on your back on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand.</p>
   <p>Press the dumbbells up until your arms are straight.</p>
   <p>Lower the dumbbells down until your arms are at a 90-degree angle. You may go slightly lower until you get a good stretch.</p>
   <p>Press the dumbbells back up until your arms are straight. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</p>
   <p>Tips: Make sure to keep your back flat on the bench and your feet flat on the floor. Try to go heavy on this exercise while still maintaining good form.</p>
