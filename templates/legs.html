    <p>Squats are the king of all leg exercises. They're the best movement for building big legs because they activate every muscle group in your legs.</p>
    <p>This compound movement will activate your quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Performing squats will also help build a strong core, which is very beneficial.</p>
    <p>But, what's important when doing this leg exercise, or any exercise for that matter, is that you perform it correctly.</p>
    <p>If you are not using the proper form, you could injure your back, knees, and hips, putting you out of action for several weeks and, worst-case scenario, months.</p>
    <p>To properly perform this exercise:</p>
    <p>Stand at a squatting station with your feet positioned roughly shoulder-width apart and your toes angled slightly outward.</p>
    <p>Press up while keeping your back and neck as straight as possible, lifting the bar from the station.</p>
    <p>Bend your knees until your thighs are just about parallel to the floor so that your hip joints are lower than your knees.</p>
    <p>Slowly raise your body back up until you are in the starting posture.</p>
