#### Description:
The purpose of the web application is to give users the ability to create an account, log in, and access information about various exercises. Users can also track and record their heaviest lift for each exercise to monitor their progress. The app aims to be a resource for people looking to improve their physical fitness by providing exercise guides and information. The app also includes a records page where users can log their weights and repetitions for each exercise, along with a date stamp, to see their progress in each muscle group.

The template folder contains several HTML files, including pages for login, registration, records, push, pull, and legs. These files use both Jinja and HTML code. The layout page includes the main HTML code, including the navbar which will be displayed on all pages using Jinja. The records HTML file uses a Jinja for loop to display the data from the "records" table, allowing users to view the information they have entered into the web application.

If a user makes a mistake or does not provide a password or username, the apology function will redirect the user to a custom meme with the HTML error code and what went wrong. The majority of the styling for the application has been implemented using the Bootstrap framework.
